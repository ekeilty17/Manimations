# Geometric Proof Video Style Guide

- Quick animation, long pauses
- On moving lines, always animate the indicators afterwards
- Equilateral triangles - Apex first, and then lines + indicators simultaneously
- explaination text at the same time as the corresponding animation
- You don't have to emphasize everything, only if the picture gets sufficiently complicated
- `.wait(2)` at least once every time `footnotes` change
- `.wait(3)` for the first title
